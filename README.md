## Make Stuff Appear
With rust!

This is a set of rust game dev experiements using mostly Piston and Specs. There's one Conrod example.

`main()` has a set of functions in it that all refer to examples. Just un-comment the one you want to run
and use

```
$ cargo run
```

to view the example.

## Things to Try
- [X] Make a Window
- [X] Make window scalable with an object inside
- [X] Make scalable window where object scales with window
- [X] Make a conrod UI element (canvas?) scale window, but only take up a partial amount of window space
- [X] Display letters
- [X] Make something move with Specs
- [ ] Typing produces the letters, like a console?
- [ ] Make a solar system thing, maybe use specs/legion as well
- [ ] Classic Battleship?

## Conrod Setup and UI flow:
